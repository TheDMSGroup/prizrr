              <br><br>
              <h4>What is Prizrr?</h4>
              <p>Prizrr is A New Way to Win! We believe entering to win sweepstakes should be Fun and EASY! That's
                  right, EASY!</p>
              <p>No calls, no surveys, no long pages of spam to scroll though. Just pick your prize and enter to win!</p>
              <p>Prizrr makes it easy and fun to enter a variety of sweeps. With 1 click entry, you're always just a
                  click away from piles of cash, gift cards to stores like Amazon, Walmart &amp; Target, and hot gadgets like
                  iPhones, iPads, and KitchenAid products.</p>
              <h4>Do people really win?</h4>
              <p>We have winners every day here at Prizrr. Winners are randomly selected through our system and 100%
                  verified.</p>
              <p>Winner announcements are in Prizrr emails. Make sure you're subscribed!</p>
              <p>We know sometimes it's tough to believe it, but people really do win! Our team loves sweepstakes and we
                  wouldn't be working here if it weren't true.</p>
              <h4>How do I know if I won?</h4>
              <p>Should you be randomly selected as a lucky winner, you will be notified via email at the email address
                  you signed up with at Prizrr. Check your email daily!</p>
              <p>Remember, we don't require a telephone number or mailing address when you sign up at Prizrr, so email is the only
              way we can notify you. Add contact@prizzr.com to your Address Book and make sure it's not going to Spam
              or Junk folders.</p>
              <h4>Is it possible to win more than one prize at a time?</h4>
              <p>It is absolutely possible to win more than one prize at the same time.  The prize drawing is a completely automated and random process. In fact, we have members who have won on our site several times. Check out our blog post highlighting <strong><a href="http://blog.prizzr.com/the-bronxs-five-time-prizzr-winner">Francisco’s 5 wins on Prizrr.</a></strong> </p>
              <h4>If I win do I have to pay shipping costs for the prize?</h4>
              <p>No, you never pay anything to Prizrr to receive your prize!</p>

               <h4>Can prizes be transferred?</h4>
              <p>No. The actual winner must claim the prize, pay taxes (if necessary), etc., and cannot transfer the prize to another person in the event they don't want the prize.</p>
              <h4>What are my odds of winning? How many people play daily?</h4>
              <p>Great question! We're all here to win, right? The odds vary drastically every single day based on the prize value and duration. We urge all members to max their entries daily so they have the best odds of winning. We also hold regularly scheduled live streams on Facebook where we select winners at random to win prizes. You can find our next event here: <a href="http://prizzr.com/cashanovas-live/">Cashanovas Live Events</a>. Be sure to Like our Facebook page to stay updated!</p>

              exclusives!</p>
              <h4>Does it cost anything to enter?</h4>
              <p>Entering is FREE!  Just go to Prizrr.com and create a free account. Once you have an account you will be able to enter all of our sweepstakes for free.  </p>
              <h4>How many times can I enter per day?</h4>
              <p>Each prize on Prizegrab has a different maximum allowable entries per day. Sometimes 5 entries are permitted per day, sometimes only one per day! Check out the Prizegrab Prizes page and see each prize's Official Rules.</p>
              <p>Sometimes we offer additional-- double, triple, or more-- bonus entries through Prizrr emails or through social media like our Prizegrab Facebook page. In
                  those cases, please check the official rules on the prize entry page.</p>
              <p>Remember, each "day" refers to 12AM ET - 11:59PM ET.</p>
              <h4>When do you add new prizes?</h4>
              <p>We are constantly evaluating new prizes. We only add what we think Prizrrbers would like the most.
                  Cash? Check! Gift cards? Check! More electronics and Apple products? Check!</p>
              <h4>I have an idea for a prize. Can I tell you?</h4>
              <p>Yes! We would love to hear from you.</p>

                  one of your emails and is delighted to hear from you.</p>

                  thoughts are extremely important to us.</p>

              <h4>How do you deliver prizes?</h4>
              <p>The answer really depends on the prize. Sometimes, it is an e-gift card, sometimes it is in the postal
                  mail. Our Prize Fulfillment team makes sure that all prizes are awarded as offered and delivered as
                  easily as possible.</p>
